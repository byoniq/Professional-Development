## Interview Preparation

Ace your interviews by preparing using the **Amazon Leadership Principles** and the **STAR Method**.

### Amazon Leadership Principles

Amazon uses 16 leadership principles to assess candidates in behavioral interviews. Here’s how to prepare for common questions:

1. **Customer Obsession** - Focus on delivering value to customers.
2. **Ownership** - Demonstrate accountability and leadership.
3. **Invent and Simplify** - Showcase your problem-solving and innovation skills.
4. **Hire and Develop the Best** - Show how you contribute to team growth.
5. **Insist on the Highest Standards** - Share how you maintain high standards.
6. **Bias for Action** - Demonstrate decision-making in fast-paced environments.

### STAR Method

Use the **STAR** method to answer behavioral interview questions:

- **S**ituation: Set the context for the story.
- **T**ask: Explain the task you had to complete.
- **A**ction: Describe the actions you took.
- **R**esult: Share the results of your actions.

#### Example:

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you resolved a major issue under tight deadlines."

**Answer Using STAR:**
- **Situation:** "Our security team found a critical vulnerability just days before a product launch."
- **Task:** "I was tasked with fixing the issue within 48 hours."
- **Action:** "I led the team to perform a vulnerability scan, prioritize fixes, and patch the issue."
- **Result:** "The vulnerability was patched in time, and the product launch was successful without security risks."
